               Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
               The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed
               at the correct position in the sorted part. <br><br>
               Insertion Sort: Basic Steps Overview <br>
               Step 1 - Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. <br>	
               Step 2 - Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.<br>	
               Step 3 - If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare 
               it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position  
               up to make space for the swapped element.<br><br>
               Insertion Sort Example: <br><br>
               Consider the following array: [ 12, 11, 13, 5, 6 ]. <br><br>
               Step 1: <br><br>
               We start at index 0 (12) and compare it with the element in index 1 (11). Since 11 is smaller than 12 the elements are swapped. 
               There are currently no items in our sorted listed prior to this operation. Once this operation is complete 12 is added to the sorted
               list and we will move onto the next index.<br><br>
               [ 12, 11, 13, 5, 6 ] -> [ <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, 13, 5, 6 ] <br><br>
               Step 2: <br><br>
               We now move to index 1 (11) and compare it with the element in index 2 (13). Since 13 is greater than 12 the elements remain unchanged. 
               The sorted list now contains [ 11, 12 ]. Each element is compared first to the unsorted value to the right of it and then to the elements
               in the sorted list. <br><br>
               [ 11, 12, 13, 5, 6 ] -> [ 11, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, 5, 6 ]
               Step 3: <br><br>
               We now move to index 2 (13) and compare it with the element in index 3 (5). Since 13 is less than 5 the elements are swapped. 5 is than compared
               to the elements in the sorted list: [ 5, 11, 12 ]. Since 5 is less than 11 and we know these elements are already sorted, 5 is placed before the 11. <br><br>
               [ 11, 12, 13, 5, 6 ] -> [ 11, 12, <b>5</b>, <b>13</b>, 6 ] <br>
               [ 11, 12, 5, 13, 6 ] -> [ <b>5</b>, 11, 12, 13, 6 ] <br><br>
               Step 4: <br><br>
               We now move to index 3 (13) and compare it with the element in index 4 (6). Since 13 is greater than 6 the elements are swapped. 6 is than compared 
               to the elements in the sorted list: [ 5, 11, 12, 13 ]. Since 6 is greater than 5 and we know these elements are already sorted, 6 is place after 5. <br><br> 
               [ 5, 11, 12, 13, 6 ] -> [ 5, 11, 12, <b>6</b>, <b>13</b> ] <br>
               [ 5, 11, 12, 6, 13 ] -> [ 5, <b>6</b>, 11, 12, 13 ] <br><br>
