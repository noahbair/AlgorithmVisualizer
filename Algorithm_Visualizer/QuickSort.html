            <p id="text">
               Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that works by dividing the data into seperate / smaller arrays. The
               process of splitting the data into these arrays is done by the <i>partition</i>. Elements are then compared to the 
               partition in terms of numeric value and sorted accordingly.

               Quicksort: Basic Steps Overview <br>
               Step 1 − Make any element as pivot <br>
               Step 2 − Partition the array on the basis of pivot <br>
               Step 3 − Apply quick sort on left partition recursively <br>
               Step 4 − Apply quick sort on right partition recursively <br><br>
               Quick Sort Example: <br><br>
               Consider the following array: [ 50, 23, 9, 18, 61, 32 ]. We need to sort this array in the most efficient manner 
               without using extra place (inplace sorting). <br><br>
               Step 1: <br><br>
               <b>Make any element as pivot:</b> Decide any value to be the pivot from the list. For convenience of code, we often select the
               rightmost index as pivot or select any at random and swap with rightmost. Suppose for two values “Low” and “High” corresponding
               to the first index and last index respectively. <br><br>In our case low is 0 and high is 5. Values at low and high are 50 and 32 and
               value at pivot is 32. <br><br><b>Partition the array on the basis of pivot:</b> Call for partitioning which rearranges the array in 
               such a way that pivot (32) comes to its actual position (of the sorted array). And to the left of the pivot, the array has all the 
               elements less than it, and to the right greater than it. <br><br>In the partition function, we start from the first element and compare it 
               with the pivot. Since 50 is greater than 32, we don’t make any change and move on to the next element 23. <br><br>Compare again with the pivot.
               Since 23 is less than 32, we swap 50 and 23. The array becomes [ 23, 50, 9, 18, 61, 32 ]. <br><br>We move on to the next element 9 which is 
               again less than pivot (32) thus swapping it with 50 makes our array as 23, 9, 50, 18, 61, 32. <br><br>Similarly, for next element 18 which 
               is less than 32, the array becomes 23, 9, 18, 50, 61, 32. Now 61 is greater than pivot (32), hence no changes. <br><br>Lastly, we swap our 
               pivot with 50 so that it comes to the correct position. <br><br>Thus the pivot (32) comes at its actual position and all elements to its left
               are lesser, and all	elements to the right are greater than itself. <br><br>
               Step 2: <br><br>
               The main array after the first step becomes [ 23, 9, 18, 32, 61, 50 ] <br><br>
               Step 3: <br><br>
               Now the list is divided into two parts:
               <br><br>Sublist before pivot element
               <br>Sublist after pivot element <br><br>
               Step 4: <br><br>
               Repeat the steps for the left and right sublists recursively. The final array thus becomes [ 9, 18, 23, 32, 50, 61 ]. <br><br>
